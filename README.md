XenForo-DeletedContentSearch
======================

Allows non visible (soft-deleted or moderated) content to be searchable by users with the permission to view deleted content.

Does not push deleted/moderated status into the search backend, and as such introduces extra overhead due to deleted content being filtered as a post processing step.
